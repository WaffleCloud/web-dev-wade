            My coding journey began 3 years ago. <br/>
            At first, I did small html projects learning from youtube tutorials and Free Code Camp. <br/>
            Then I began attending free classes at CodeSmith. <br/>
            <br/> <br/>
            I auditioned and was  accepted into CodeSmith's learning intensive <br/>
            program where I studied and worked with <br/>
            data structures, React, Redux, SQL, noSQL, Express, Jest, Docker, Electron, and Kubernetes. <br/>
            My time at CodeSmith was filled with group projects where we utlilzed SCRUM, <br/>
            daily algos, pair programming, as well as several weekly informational sessions <br/>
            about emerging and trending tech and industry best practices. <br/>
            <br/> <br/>
            Currently, I am a freelance front end webdeveloper, specializing in React. <br/>
            I love using my creativity and skill to bring my client's visions to life. <br/>
            I am open to work and am looking for a remote position in developing front end projects and UI. <br/>
